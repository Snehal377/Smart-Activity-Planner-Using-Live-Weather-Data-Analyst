# Smart-Activity-Planner-Using-Live-Weather-Data-Analyst
A smart planner that uses live weather data to suggest the best outdoor or indoor activities. It analyzes temperature, rain, wind, and conditions to help users plan their day efficiently.

📌Objectives :
1) To fetch real-time weather information using a city name
2) To predict rain using a Machine Learning model
3) To recommend suitable activities based on weather conditions
4) To provide an interactive and visually appealing user interface
5) To integrate frontend, backend, API, and ML into a single project

📑Technologies Used :
Frontend:
   HTML
   CSS
   JavaScript
Backend :
   Python
   Flask Framework
   Requests(API calls)
Machine Learning:
   1) Scikit-learn
   2)Random Forest Classifier
